This is a task in progress.  And, yes, it has a lot of messy code. This is not yet ready for prime time. 

It is to create a game that contestants in Science Olympiad can enter the event called "Game Agent" .. 
... and they are tasked with creating a game agent that can beat the game. 
The current Event Description will be in a second file on this git project. 

Version #1 is as complete as I will make it for now.  It clearly has to be modified to be able
to allow a realtively simple RML Agent to be built by beginners. Version #1 is being released to 
friends for comments.   I am moving on to version #2. 

For version #2, Part #2 - flying from the launch site to the landings site - will stay largely 
the same ... it can be handled something like a snake game, but in 3d. Part #1 will change for 
a maze to a "snake without a tail" game ... there are plenty of tutorials on how to do this on youtube.
