Drive the tank through the tunnels collecting power nodules.  When you have enough,  drive  to the launch area. Drive onto the launch pad before engaging the pulse rocket, otherwise, you will kaboom. 

Goal for Task #2
Launch the pulse rocket tank, \"fly\" to the landing site,  and land safely in the landing zone. Don't fire the tank's gun until you are at least 5m above the ground, otherwise, you will kaboom."

text = "Story:
An incredible new source of power has been discovered that is not radioactive.  Its byproducts are not  harmful to the environment. You are the driver of our pulse rocket tank carrying goods and passengers from the launch site to a  landing site. The launch site is always in the same location, however, the landing site changes depending on which outpost you are supporting on the current mission.  You must first collect power nodules in the caverns, then move to the launch site. Then, you must fly high enough to avoid the mountains.  Your navigation computer builds an optimized flight path to get there the fastest, with the least amount of bombs used. Additional factors that affect optimization are wind sheer, and, acceleration due to gravity and air density on the planet you are operating on.  Your tank  must land  at a speed less than 5m/s otherwise it crashes and burns.  Landing anywhere other than a landing site also causes your tank to crash and burn.  Thus, you should use your Agent to determine an optimized flight path to follow. The best Agents earn the highest rewards, so develop an Agent that works well in all environments. Be aware that the shortest horizontal path is often not the optimized path due to variation in mountain terrain.  Good Luck. "

Heading is  from tank forward, not turret forward
Speed vector  is in meters/second, where

Height vector is in meters, where

Location vector of landing site is in meters
Distance to landing site in meters from tank position
     the launch site is always (x,y,z)  = (0,0,0)
